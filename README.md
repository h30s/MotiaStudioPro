## 🎯 The Problem

Building production backends requires:
- Juggling multiple frameworks (API server, queue, worker, monitoring)
- Hours of boilerplate code and configuration
- Complex deployment orchestration
- Steep learning curves for new frameworks

**Result:** Developers spend 60-70% of time on setup instead of business logic.
